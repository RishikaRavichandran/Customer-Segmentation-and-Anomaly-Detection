# Customer-Segmentation-and-Anomaly-Detection
This project explores unsupervised machine learning techniques to group customers based on their spending behavior and detect anomalies using the Wholesale Customers Dataset.


---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **File:** `Wholesale customers data.csv`
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Features:** Annual spending on categories like Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, and Delicassen.

## âœ… Tasks Completed

### 1. K-Means Clustering
- Applied K-Means algorithm to group customers into clusters.
- Visualized clusters using PCA 2D projection.

### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
- Generated a dendrogram using hierarchical (agglomerative) clustering.
- Identified customer segments based on linkage distances.

### 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Reduced high-dimensional data to 2D and 3D for visualization.
- Preserved variance while enabling better visual insights.

### 4. Anomaly Detection
- Detected outliers within clusters based on distance from centroids.
- Visualized anomalies using PCA-based scatter plots.
